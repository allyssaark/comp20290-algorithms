Practical 4: Elementary Sorting                                           
What am I doing today? 
Today’s practical focuses on 3 things: 
1. Writing several elementary sorting algorithms
2. Developing a testing framework to assess the performance of your algorithms
3. Summarizing the results


Instructions
Try all the questions. Ask for help from the demonstrators if you get stuck. 


***Grading: Remember if you complete the practical, add the code to your GitHub repo which needs to be submitted at the end of the course for an extra 5%

Quick Questions
1. How many compares does insertion sort make on an input array that is already sorted?
Constant	1
Logarithmic	logn
Linear		n
Quadratic	n^2
	

2. What is a stable sorting algorithm?
An algorithm that is considered “sorted” if two equal keys appear to be in the same order in the sorted output as they did in the input order.

3. What is an external sorting algorithm?
A. Algorithm that uses tape or disk during the sort



4. Identify 6 ways of classifying sorting algorithms?
1. Time complexity
2. Space complexity (usage of memory)
3. Stability
4. Internal / External
5. Recursive / non-recursive
6. Comparison sort / non-comparison sort
