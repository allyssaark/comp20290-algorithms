Practical 5: Advanced Sorting Algorithms 
         
What am I doing today? 
Todayâ€™s practical focuses on:  
1. Implementing Mergesort from pseudo-code and comparing Mergesort to Insertion Sort for increasing input sizes
2. Implementing enhanced Mergesort
3. Compare the performance between 3 sorting algorithms


Instructions
Try all the questions. Ask for help from the demonstrators if you get stuck. 


Grading: Remember if you complete the practical, add the code to your GitHub repo which needs to be submitted at the end of the course for an extra 5%
